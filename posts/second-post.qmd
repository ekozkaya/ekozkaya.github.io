Me and a friend worked on a ggplot, learnt how to code and also tried to fold code. These are the results. From the ggplot examples, we are choosing the lollipop chart. Here is the link: https://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html#Lollipop%20Chart

```{r}
#│ code-fold: true
#│ code-summary: "Show the code"
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())

cty_mpg <- data.frame(
  make = c("Chevrolet", "Audi", "Toyota", "Honda"),
  mileage = c(15, 17.5, 18, 24)
)

ggplot(cty_mpg, aes(x = make, y = mileage)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = make,
                   xend = make,
                   y = 0,
                   yend = mileage)) + 
  labs(title = "Lollipop Chart", 
       subtitle = "Make Vs Avg. Mileage", 
       caption = "source: mpg") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 65, vjust = 0.6))
```

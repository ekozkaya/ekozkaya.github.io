Why I am Starting this Blog. This Blog is going to be used for my thoughts and to think out loud.

I am starting this to give myself permission to explore ideas that are not fully formed, maybe questions or research questions I might have.

I plan to write about questions I do not have answers to, about things that might not yet have answers. Maybe reflective, analytical or even personal. I will try to be honest in my attempts.

This is not a place for polished arguments or final conclusions. I will place my curiosities and patterns I notice. If you are reading this, you are welcome to think alongside me. No need to agree or debate not to process and maybe have your own thoughts.

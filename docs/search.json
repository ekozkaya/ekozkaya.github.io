Maybe reflective, analytical or even personal. I will try to be honest in my attempts.\nThis is not a place for polished arguments or final conclusions. I will place my curiosities and patterns I notice. If you are reading this, you are welcome to think alongside me. No need to agree or debate not to process and maybe have your own thoughts."
